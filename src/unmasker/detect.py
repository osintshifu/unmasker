"""Running every detector over one reading of one file.

This was inside `cli.py` while the command line was its only caller. The
directory survey is a second one, and a module that imports the command line to
borrow one function is a cycle waiting for the command line to import it back.

Nothing here decides how anything is printed. It answers *what does this file
disagree with itself about*, once, for whoever is asking.

**Notes come back with the findings.** Several detectors learn something about
their own coverage while running - a page that could not be rendered, a tool
that is not installed, a document that could not be laid out - and that is the
difference between *searched and nothing there* and *nothing looked*, which is
the distinction this whole tool is built on. An earlier version rebound the
extraction here to carry them and returned only the findings, so every one of
those sentences was written and thrown away.
