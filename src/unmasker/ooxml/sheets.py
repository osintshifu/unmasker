"""A workbook's sheets, and which of them an application agreed not to draw.

SpreadsheetML states hiding on the thing being hidden, which makes it the
easier of the two families to read - and hides a trap in the easiness.

    <sheet name="Workings" state="hidden"/>       a whole sheet
    <row r="4" hidden="true">                     a row
    <col min="4" max="4" hidden="true"/>          a *range* of columns

Two producer facts, both measured against a file LibreOffice Calc wrote rather
than read out of the specification:

- **`hidden` is written on every row, saying `false` on most of them.** A
  reader that tests whether the attribute is present rather than what it says
  reports every row in the workbook as concealed.
- **`min` and `max` are a range, not an identifier.** One `col` element can
  hide forty columns, and each of them has to be counted or the values in
  thirty-nine of them go unreported.

Cell text arrives three ways and all three are needed: `t="s"` is an index into
`xl/sharedStrings.xml`, `t="inlineStr"` carries the characters in the cell, and
a cell with no `t` at all holds a number written out in `<v>`.

Comments live in their own part, reached through the worksheet's relationships,
with authors held in a separate list and referenced by position. They are the
same finding a Word comment and a PDF annotation produce, so they come back as
the `Comment` the shared revision record already defines.

Change tracking lives in `xl/revisions/`, which only a shared workbook has, and
it is the part of this format most easily read wrongly. Three things about it:

- **It is one log part per editing session**, each reached by relationship from
  `revisionHeaders.xml`. Reading `revisionLog1.xml` and stopping reports one
  change out of however many there are, and gives no sign of having stopped.
- **The author and the date are on the header**, not on the change, so an
  `rcc` read on its own has nobody attached to it.
- **`<nc>` holds the old value.** LibreOffice writes the "new cell" element
  with the *previous* contents, so a reader that believed the log would report
  a cell that changed from 240000 to 240000. The current value comes out of the
  sheet, which is where a person would look.

No new dependency: an .xlsx is a zip of XML and both are in the standard
library.
