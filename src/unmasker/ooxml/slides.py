"""A presentation's slides, read out of PresentationML.

Hiding is on the slide itself here, which makes it the easier of the two
families - and hides the trap that made it worth measuring:

    <p:sld ... show="0">     the slide is skipped
    <p:sld ...>              the slide is shown

**The attribute is absent when the slide is shown.** That is the opposite of
what the same producer does for a hidden *row* in a spreadsheet, where it
writes `hidden="false"` out loud on every row. A reader carrying that habit
across - testing what the attribute says rather than whether it is there -
finds no hidden slides at all, because there is nothing to read.

Order comes from `ppt/presentation.xml`, not from the part names: `slide10.xml`
sorts before `slide2.xml`, and a deck reported with its slides renumbered sends
a reader to the wrong one.

Notes live in their own parts, reached through each slide's relationships. A
notes slide repeats the slide's own text inside a placeholder, so the body
placeholder is the only one worth reading - taking every `a:t` in the part
would quote the slide back as though the speaker had written it.

No new dependency: a .pptx is a zip of XML and both are in the standard
library.
