"""Surveying a directory instead of a file.

One file at a time is a demonstration. A case arrives as a folder, and the
question a person has then is *which of these do I need to open* - a different
question from *what is hidden in this one*, and it needs a different answer.

## Triage without ranking

`CONTRIBUTING.md` forbids ranking findings against each other, and this is
where that rule is hardest to keep: every instinct says to sort the worst files
to the top. So the survey counts **files per kind of finding** instead and
lists the files in path order. A
reader still learns where to look, and the tool still has not decided for them
which document matters most.

Counting *files* rather than findings is the same rule one level up. A document
with eight covered lines would otherwise make `covered-text` look eight times
more common than it is, which is a ranking wearing a tally's clothes.

## Refusals are a section, not a footnote

A folder of forty-seven files where six could not be read, reported as "twelve
files hide something", tells a reader the other thirty-five are clean. They are
not: nobody looked at six of them.

At the level of one file, *searched and found nothing* against *there was
nothing to search* is a nuance this project is careful about. At the level of a
directory it is the difference between a true report and a misleading one, so
`refused` is carried in the record beside `read` and each refusal keeps the
reason it was refused.

## What is deliberately not here

No parallelism and no progress bar. Both are answers to a measurement nobody
has taken yet, and a thread pool around a parser that will be handed hostile
files is a decision that needs its own argument.
