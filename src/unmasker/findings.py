"""The evidence model.

Two rules from `CONTRIBUTING.md` shape everything here.

**Different questions are not ranked against each other.** A `Finding` carries
no score, and nothing sorts findings by strength. A page can have a rectangle
over its text *and* invisible characters *and* stale metadata; those are three
findings, not one winner. Print only the winner and a geotagged photograph
that had also been downloaded reports its source URL and no GPS at all.

**Nothing implies a precision we do not have.** `Basis` is a word, not a number,
because `55` reads as a probability and never was one. A word can be argued
with by the person reading the report, which is the whole point: this tool shows
evidence and lets its reader draw the conclusion.
