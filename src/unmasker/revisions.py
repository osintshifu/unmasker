"""Tracked changes and comments, and what to report about them.

A deletion is not an OOXML idea. Word keeps deleted text in `w:delText`,
LibreOffice keeps it in `<text:deletion>`, and both are the same statement
about a document: *this was taken off the page and left in the file.* So the
record and the findings live here, and each format contributes only a reader
that fills the record in.

Three findings, and the split between them is the design.

**`deleted-text`** — one per deletion. The words are in the file and not on the
page, which is the same statement this tool makes about a black bar and about a
zero-width character. The author and the date go in the summary, because a
deletion without them is half the evidence.

**`comment`** — one per comment. A comment is not part of the document a reader
prints, and it is very often where the candid sentence lives. A PDF says the
same thing with an annotation, and that finding shares this name.

**`revision-history`** — exactly one, for the whole file. Who edited a document
and when is *one fact about the document*, not one fact per change. A draft
with two hundred insertions must not produce two hundred findings; that is a
report nobody finishes reading.
It is `SELF_REPORTED`, which is what that class was defined for: the
file's own account of itself, believed only as far as a file can be. An author
name in a document is whatever the application was configured to say.
