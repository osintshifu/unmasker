"""The screen a bare `unmasker` prints.

Typing a tool's name and getting `error: the following arguments are required`
tells a reader they were wrong and nothing else. A landing screen's job is to
get somebody to their first useful command, and then get out of the way.

## The mark

    █████ker
    unmasker

A bar dragged too short, and the word still there underneath it. The top line
is what a human sees; the bottom is what a machine reads; the gap between them
is the entire tool. It needs no caption, and it is drawn in the only two rows a
terminal can be relied on to give you.

It is unmasker's own wordmark rather than a borrowed one set in another font:
a reader should never have to wonder which tool just printed.

## The shape below it is everybody's

`USAGE`, `OPTIONS`, `EXAMPLES`, `EXIT STATUS` — flush-left capitals, two-space
indent, no rules and no boxes. That is what `gh`, `rg`, `fd` and every other
modern command-line tool prints, and a reader who has used any of them knows
how to read this one in a second. A landing screen exists to get somebody to
the right command, not to be memorable.

Three things follow from that, and each replaced something this file used to
do:

**No prose.** What the tool is for is in `README.md`, where a reader has
scrolling and links. Repeating it here made the first screen a page.

**No rules across the terminal.** The report draws to the width it measured
because its values wrap; a help screen's content is short and fixed, so
stretching it to a 200-column terminal leaves a line of description marooned
half a metre from the flag it belongs to. This lays out at `WIDTH` and narrows
only when the terminal is smaller.

**No section that states a total.** The screen used to announce a detector
count, which is a claim, and a claim on a front door is the first thing a
reader checks and the first thing to go stale. Counts belong in the README
beside the list they count.

There is no `COMMANDS` section because there are no subcommands - one file
argument and four flags. Printing an empty heading to look like `gh` would be
furniture.
