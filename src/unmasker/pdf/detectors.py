"""Tier 1: what a page shows against what it holds.

Two detectors, both of which the interpreter has made cheap.

**Text under a filled shape.** The reason this project exists. A black bar is
drawn over a name; the name is never removed; every parser can read it.

**Text that is never painted.** Render mode 3 puts glyphs in the file that no
renderer draws - selectable, searchable, invisible. A real technique, and free
once the interpreter tracks `Tr`.

## What decides coverage, and what deliberately does not

**Painting order.** A rectangle drawn *before* a piece of text is a background
and hides nothing; the same rectangle drawn after it is a redaction. Nothing
else in the file distinguishes the two, which is why the interpreter stamps an
order on everything it emits.

**Alpha.** A shape at zero alpha paints nothing. Calling it a redaction would
be reporting a finding that is not there.

**Size.** A page-sized fill is the background. Context decides: the shape
alone cannot say what it is, but its size against the page can.

**Not colour.** A white fill over black text hides it exactly as well as a
black one. Colour decides what the *report* says a human sees, never whether
the text is covered.

## Per character, not per run

A bar that covers half a line is a finding about half a line. Reporting the
whole run whenever any part of it was touched would overstate every partial
redaction in the same direction, and the first document where a reader can see
the page would show them the tool exaggerating. `tests/specimens/pdf/
libreoffice-writer-partial-bars.pdf` exists to hold this honest, and the words
it covers were settled by poppler rather than by anything here.

    on `libreoffice-calc-rotated-headers.pdf`. It is the same failure Chrome's
    one-glyph-per-`Tj` produced, arriving from a different direction.

    hidden sentence. Nothing in the file distinguishes them, and a spreadsheet
    exported to PDF can produce a screenful of the first - after which a reader
    scrolls past the second.

    with visible text beside it on the same line is what an overflow looks
    like; a line clipped away entirely is not. So the first is
