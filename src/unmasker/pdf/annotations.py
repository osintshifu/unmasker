"""Annotations: what hangs off a page without being on it.

A comment in a PDF is a dictionary attached to the page. The text is in
`/Contents`, the author in `/T`, and none of it is part of the page: it does not
print, `pdftotext` does not report it, and a reader looking at the document
never meets it. Every PDF library reads it in one line.

This was a blind spot rather than a gap in the specimens. The interpreter read
the page's content stream and never looked at `/Annots` at all, so no amount of
content-stream work would ever have found a comment - the same class of miss as
reading only the Info dictionary and never the XMP packet.

## The one subtype that is not a gap

`/FreeText` draws its contents on the page. A reader sees exactly what a parser
gets, and reporting it would be the tool calling the visible document a
concealment. It is read and not reported, and the distinction is a test.

## What is not read

Appearance streams. An annotation may carry an `/AP` form that paints anything
at all, including a black rectangle over text, and nothing here interprets one.
That is a real technique and it needs a producer not available here -
`tests/specimens/README.md` names it.
