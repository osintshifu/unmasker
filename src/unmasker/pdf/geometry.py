"""Matrices, rectangles and colour, in page space.

Nothing here decides anything. A `Colour` knows its luminance and whether it is
close to another colour; it does not know whether it is "a redaction bar". That
judgement belongs to a detector, and keeping it out of the geometry is what lets
the report show a reader the numbers it used.

Page space is PDF user space: points, origin at the bottom-left of the page,
Y increasing upward. Every coordinate that leaves the interpreter is in it,
because the alternative - reporting the operand values a producer happened to
write - is wrong by a factor of 0.75 and a Y flip on any file Chrome made.
