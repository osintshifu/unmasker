"""What a file says about itself, and what kind of thing each field is.

Reading these fields to answer *where did this file come from* is a different
job, and a tool built for it reports each field as an origin claim. Two things
carry over from that reading regardless: dates have to be normalised out of
each container's own format, and every property should be kept rather than a
chosen few, because no fixed list anticipates which one an investigation will
want.

What is different here is the roles.

## The name of a field is evidence

`CONTRIBUTING.md` sets out the worked example. `LibreOffice/24.2.7.2$Linux_X86_64`
contains a dotted quad; pattern-matching alone reports an IP address; the field
is called `Application`, so it is a version. Context you already have beats a
cleverer pattern.

So every field carries a **role**, decided by its name *and its container*, and
the role decides what may be said about it:

    tool      what produced the file. Never a finding: every PDF has a
              Producer, and a tool that fired on those would exit non-zero on
              every document ever written.
    content   something a person put there - a name, a title, a client, a
              codename. A finding when the document does not show it.
    time      a timestamp, normalised. A finding only when two of them
              contradict each other.
    count     revisions, editing minutes, page counts. Context, not a finding.
    other     read, kept, and not reasoned about.

The container matters as much as the name: a PDF's `/Creator` is the
application that made the original document, and an OOXML `dc:creator` is a
person. One name, two meanings.
