"""The `WordDocument` stream: where a .doc keeps its text, and in what shape.

A .doc does not store its text as a run of characters you can find and decode.
It stores a **piece table**: a list saying that characters 0 to 68 live at one
offset in one encoding, 68 to 460 at another offset in another. Word wrote it
that way so a save could append rather than rewrite, and the consequence is
that the text of a document is scattered through the stream in the order it was
edited, not the order it is read.

Three things here came out of real LibreOffice output rather than out of the
specification, and each of them is a way this reader would otherwise have been
quietly wrong.

**The main story is not the document.** All of a file's text shares one
character-position space, and the FIB says how much of it belongs to what:
`ccpText`, then footnotes, headers and footers, comments, endnotes, text boxes.
In the stories specimen the main story is 267 characters of 504. A reader that
took `[0, ccpText)` would search just over half the file and then report having
searched it - and the part it skipped holds the comment naming a bidder and the
header marked *internal circulation only*. That is the standing failure of
this kind of reader: correct against the specification, and decoding nothing
that matters out of anything real.

**A hyperlink is a field, not a run.** The bytes hold
`0x13 HYPERLINK "https://..." 0x14 published summary 0x15` - an instruction, a
separator, a result. The page shows the result. Concatenating the characters
would put a URL into the visible text, and every detector downstream would then
be working from a page nobody can see. So the two are separated here, and the
instruction is kept rather than dropped: it is the whole reason a forensic tool
opens the file.

**The text is UTF-16 even when it is all ASCII.** The specification presents
the compressed 8-bit piece first and LibreOffice never writes one, so a reader
built in the order the specification reads gets the rarer case tested and the
common one guessed at.

What this does not read is character formatting. Hidden text - Word's
`fHidden` run property - is a `Chpx` in a different table and is named in the
specimen notes as the next thing rather than passed over in silence.
