"""An OpenDocument spreadsheet's sheets, and which of them are not drawn.

ODF states the same three facts as SpreadsheetML and states them differently,
which is the reason both readers exist rather than one.

    <table:table-row table:visibility="collapse">      a row
    <table:table-column table:visibility="collapse"/>  a column
    <table:table table:style-name="ta3">               a sheet - and the style
      ...<style:table-properties table:display="false"/>   says whether it shows

The sheet is the awkward one. Its visibility is not on the sheet: it is on a
named style somewhere else in the file, so a reader that looks for an attribute
finds nothing and reports a workbook with a concealed sheet as clean. Two
formats, the same fact, one of them behind an indirection.

Three more things this format does that the other does not:

- **A cell has no address.** Where SpreadsheetML writes `r="D4"`, ODF says
  nothing and means *the next one*, so position has to be counted - through
  `table:number-columns-repeated`, which stands in for a run of identical
  cells, and through `table:covered-table-cell`, which is a cell a merge has
  swallowed and which still occupies its column.
- **The repeats run to the edge of the sheet.** LibreOffice closes a table with
  a single row repeated 1 048 570 times. Materialising that is a million-entry
  set for no information at all, so hidden rows and columns are recorded as
  ranges while walking and resolved at the end against the ones that actually
  hold a value. A hidden empty row conceals nothing and is not a finding
  either way.
- **A comment sits inside the cell it annotates.** Its text is *not* the cell's
  text, and a reader that walks the subtree naively reports the comment as the
  value in the cell - the same trap `readers/odf.py` documents for annotations
  in a paragraph, arriving one container down.

`table:visibility` has a third value. `filter` means a filter is holding the row
back rather than a person having hidden it, which is a weaker claim, and the
two are kept apart here so the report can keep them apart.

No new dependency: an .ods is a zip of XML and both are in the standard library.
