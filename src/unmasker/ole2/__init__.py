"""The compound file: a filesystem inside a file.

`.doc`, `.xls` and `.ppt` are each a FAT filesystem in a single file - sectors,
an allocation table, a directory tree - with a second, smaller filesystem
nested inside for streams below a cutoff, normally 4096 bytes. Nothing in the
standard library reads one, and one runtime dependency is not becoming two,
so it is written here.

**The mini stream is not optional.** In a real Word 97 document every stream
worth having - the metadata, the text, the table - is under the cutoff and
therefore lives in the mini stream rather than in sectors. A reader that
handled full sectors first and left the small ones for later would return
nothing at all from a genuine file while passing any suite built from the
specification. The specimen was read before this module was written for exactly
that reason.

What is here is the container. What a `WordDocument` stream means is a
different format and a different problem; this hands over the bytes.

Everything is bounds-checked and every chain is cycle-checked, because this
reads files somebody else wrote and some of them are wrong on purpose.
