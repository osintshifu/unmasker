"""The terminal report.

The layout follows an established design language rather than a second one
invented here. What that settles:

- **No boxes.** A frame costs two columns on every line it wraps, and nothing
  in a forensic report needs to be in one. Grouping is a one-character gutter.
- **Nothing is truncated.** A value too long for the line wraps. An ellipsis
  sends the reader to fetch the value another way, which defeats having read
  the report.
- **Section headers only when there is more than one section.** A file whose
  findings are all of one kind gets no headers; the grouping would be noise.
- **A column is sized per section, not once per screen.** One global width
  makes a layout look *almost* aligned, which reads worse than not aligning.

What is particular to unmasker is the shape of an entry. It answers "what does
this look like, against what does it say", so every entry is two readings and
the gap between them.
