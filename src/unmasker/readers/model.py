"""What a reader hands back, and why it carries more than a string.

**"Nothing found" has two meanings.** It can mean *searched, and it is not
there*; it can mean *there was nothing to search*. That difference is easily
lost between the code that knows it and the report that prints it, so it is
carried in the data rather than reconstructed later.

So the difference is carried in the data, not reconstructed later. `has_text`
answers whether there was anything to search at all, and `remarks` says why not
in the reader's own words - the reader is the only layer that knows a PDF page
had no fonts in its resources, and by the time the report runs, that is gone.
