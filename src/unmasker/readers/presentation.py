"""Presentations, in both families.

`unmasker` refused a deck outright until this existed, and said so rather than
half-reading it: an `.odp` is a zip with a `content.xml` in it, so it would
otherwise have reached the reader for text documents, which has no concept of a
slide nobody sees. It would have read a hidden slide and a speaker note as
ordinary visible prose and then reported the deck clean - the same defect the
spreadsheet reader was written to remove.

The refusal stood for a long time for a reason worth keeping in view: the
reader was blocked on the *specimen*, not on the parsing. Nothing on the
machine could write a deck, and a detector proved only against a hand-built
fixture is the shape of the bug that started this project.

So the rule this reader is built on is the spreadsheet's: **a slide an
application skips is not body text.** The visible slides go into the
extraction, where the character detectors will search them; the hidden ones and
every speaker note stay in the slide record and are reported as what they are.
