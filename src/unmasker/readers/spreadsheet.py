"""Spreadsheets, in both families.

A spreadsheet needs its own reader for one reason, and it is not that the XML
is different. Until this existed, an .ods fell through to the reader for text
documents - both are a zip with a `content.xml` in it - and `unmasker` printed
**nothing hidden found** over a workbook with a hidden column, a hidden row and
a hidden sheet in it, having read every concealed value as ordinary visible
prose. That is worse than not reading the file: it is the tool stating
something the evidence does not support, which `CONTRIBUTING.md` forbids outright.

So the rule this reader is built on: **a cell an application has agreed not to
draw is not body text.** The visible cells go into the extraction, where the
character detectors will search them; the concealed ones stay in the sheet
record, where they are reported as what they are. It is the same split the
DOCX reader makes between `w:t` and `w:delText`, one container along.

A cell comment is the same finding a Word comment and a PDF annotation produce,
so it comes back on the shared revision record and is reported by the detector
that already exists for it.
