"""Word 97, Excel 97 and PowerPoint 97: the compound-file formats.

These are not zips and not XML. Each is a filesystem in a file, read by
`unmasker.ole2`, and what this reader takes out of it is the metadata: the two
property streams every Office application has written since 1997, holding the
author, the title, the company, the revision count and the timestamps.

**Word's text is read; the other two are not.** `unmasker.word` reads the
`WordDocument` stream - the piece table, the stories a document keeps its
footnotes and headers and comments in, and the property tables that say which
characters are deleted or hidden. The `Workbook` stream's BIFF records and the
PowerPoint record stream are each a separate problem of their own size and
neither is solved.

Where the text was not read, that is stated in a remark **naming the format**
and carried on the extraction as `text_unread`. Loosening that remark to keep
covering Word once Word became readable is exactly how a report ends up
claiming a search that never happened, so the corpus holds a .xls to fail the
test if it ever slips: a document whose text was never read is not a document
whose text came back clean, and the metadata detector is told not to claim a
gap it could not look for.
