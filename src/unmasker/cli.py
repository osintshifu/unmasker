"""The command line.

Modes are commands, not flags - `CONTRIBUTING.md` - so there is exactly one thing to
do here and no mode switch. `--json` changes the shape of the output, not what
the tool did, which is what keeps it a flag.

Exit codes, and why there are three rather than two:

    0   the analysis finished and established nothing
    1   one or more findings were established
    2   nothing was established and the analysis did not finish

There is deliberately no `--strict`: 1 is the CI gate already. But 2 has to be
distinct from 0, because a file the tool did not finish reading is not a file
that came back clean, and a pipeline that cannot tell those apart will
eventually wave through the one document it should have stopped.

**A finding outranks an unfinished analysis.** `findings and not complete` is
1, never 2. Two facts do not fit in one integer, and of the two, the finding
is the one already established: an OCR pass that failed on page 7 does not
make the black bar on page 1 less real. It also matters operationally, because
2 is the code a pipeline is most likely to treat as its own problem - retry,
skip, allow-failure - and a document with a finding in it must not be handed
to that path. Completeness is carried in the report and in `--json`, where a
consumer that needs both bits can have both.
