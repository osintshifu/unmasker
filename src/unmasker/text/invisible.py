"""Tier 2: characters that change what a reader sees without changing what a
parser gets.

Pure string analysis, so it runs on anything that yields text - PDF, DOCX, HTML,
Markdown, source code - and needs none of the PDF geometry. It also covers the
prompt-injection case on its own: a retrieval pipeline reads the tag characters
below, and the human reviewing the document never sees them.

## The hard part is the silence

Finding a zero-width joiner is trivial. Knowing when *not* to report one is the
whole job:

- U+200D inside `\U0001f468‍\U0001f469‍\U0001f467` is a family emoji.
- U+200C between Persian letters is ordinary orthography, not a payload.
- A byte-order mark at offset 0 is how the file was saved.
- Japanese mixes Han, Hiragana and Katakana in one word as a matter of course.

Each of those is suppressed here, and each has a test. A detector that fires on
them teaches its reader to skip the report, and a report that gets skipped is
worth less than no report.

## What it deliberately does not do

It does not decide that anything is an attack. A word spanning two scripts is
reported as spanning two scripts, with `Basis.CIRCUMSTANTIAL`, and the reader
decides. `CONTRIBUTING.md`: never state something the evidence does not support.
