"""Colour, and the one rule that governs it.

**Colour encodes how the tool knows, never what it found.** A reader learns the
classes once and can then triage by eye. There is no red-means-danger scheme
here and there must never be one: severity is the reader's judgement, and a tool
that colours by severity has made that judgement for them.

`direct` takes the green slot, because it is the strongest class and it means
*this was observed, not inferred*.
