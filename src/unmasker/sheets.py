"""Hidden sheets, rows and columns, and what to report about them.

A spreadsheet conceals differently from every other container this tool reads.
There is no geometry, no invisible character and no tracked change. A row, a
column or an entire sheet carries an attribute saying not to draw it, and every
value in it stays in the file exactly as typed. Someone selects three columns,
right-clicks, chooses Hide, and sends the workbook out believing the numbers
are gone.

Hiding is not an OOXML idea and not an ODF one. Excel writes `hidden="true"`
on the row; LibreOffice writes `table:visibility="collapse"`; for a whole sheet
one writes `state="hidden"` on the sheet and the other points at a style that
says `table:display="false"`. All four are the same statement about a document:
*this is in the file and not on the screen.* So the record and the findings
live here, and each format contributes only a reader that fills the record in -
the arrangement `revisions.py` already uses for tracked changes.

Three rules decide the shape of what gets reported.

**A run of hidden rows is one finding, not one per row.** Hiding rows 10 to 40
is one act by one person, and both formats express it as a range anyway. A
finding per row is a report nobody finishes.

**Rows and columns inside a hidden sheet are not reported.** The sheet is
already the finding. Saying that row 4 of an invisible sheet is also invisible
tells a reader nothing they did not just read.

**A filtered row is not the same claim as a hidden one.** A filter is a live
working state - the rows come back when it is cleared, and the person looking
at the screen knows they set it. It is still text in the file that is not on
the screen, so it is still reported, but as `circumstantial`: consistent with
concealment and with an ordinary afternoon's work.
