"""Change tracking in a spreadsheet: the previous value of a cell.

A bid edited from 240 000 down to 198 000 still holds the 240 000, beside the
name of whoever changed it and the minute they did. It is `w:delText` again,
arriving through a container that has cells instead of paragraphs - and unlike
a Word deletion, this one has a *current* value to sit beside, so both columns
of the report carry real text. It is the only finding in the project where
`human sees` is a value rather than an absence.

Both families carry all of it, by different routes. ODF keeps a
`<table:tracked-changes>` block at the top of the spreadsheet body; OOXML keeps
`xl/revisions/`, which is the shared-workbook revision log - one header per
editing session, each pointing at its own log part. A first look at only
`revisionLog1.xml` suggested the .xlsx export was lossy. It is not: there were
three log parts, and the second and third held the change and the deletion the
first did not.
