"""The `WordDocument` stream: where a .doc actually keeps its text.

Every number here was read out of the specimens before the reader existed,
which for this format matters more than usual. Three things the specification
does not warn about, and all three came out of real LibreOffice output:

**The main story is not the document.** A .doc lays its text end to end in one
character-position space and the FIB says how long each part is: `ccpText`,
then footnotes, headers and footers, comments, endnotes, text boxes. In
`libreoffice-writer-word97-stories.doc` the main story is 267 characters of
504. A reader that took `[0, ccpText)` would search just over half the file and
then report that it had searched it - and the part it skipped holds a comment
naming a bidder and a header marked *internal circulation only*.

**A hyperlink is a field, not a run.** The bytes hold `0x13 HYPERLINK "..."
0x14 published summary 0x15`: an instruction, a separator, a result. Only the
result is on the page. Concatenating the run would put a URL into the visible
text, and every detector downstream would then be told a person could read it.

**The text is UTF-16 even when it is all ASCII.** The specification presents
the compressed 8-bit piece as the ordinary case. LibreOffice never writes one.
