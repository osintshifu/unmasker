"""Surveying a directory instead of a file.

One file at a time is a demonstration. A case arrives as a folder, and the
question a person actually has is *which of these do I need to open* - which
is a different question from *what is hidden in this one*, and needs a
different answer.

## Triage without ranking

`CONTRIBUTING.md` forbids ranking findings against each other, and a directory
report is where that rule is hardest to keep: every instinct says to sort the
worst files to the top. So it does not: count **files per kind of finding**,
list the files that hide
something in path order, and never claim one is worse than another. A reader
still knows where to look and the tool still has not judged for them.

## The section that matters most

A folder of forty-seven files where six could not be read, reported as
"twelve files hide something", tells a reader that the other thirty-five are
clean. They are not. Nobody looked at six of them.

At the level of one file, *searched and found nothing* against *there was
nothing to search* is a nuance. At the level of a directory it is the
difference between a true report and a misleading one, which is why the
refusals are a section of their own rather than a footnote.
