"""Turning a file into text, and being honest about how much text there was.

The rule these tests exist to enforce is the one `CONTRIBUTING.md` names: **"nothing
found" has two meanings.** It can mean *searched, and it is not there*. It can
mean *there was nothing to search*. A reader who confuses the two has drawn a
conclusion the tool never supported, so the extraction has to carry that
difference out of the reader rather than let the report guess at it.

`tests/specimens/pdf/flattened-to-image.pdf` is the case in point: four black
bars, no fonts, no text objects. The tool must not say "no hidden text found"
about it.
