"""The screen a bare `unmasker` prints.

A landing screen is the one piece of output nobody re-reads and everybody sees
once, which is exactly the shape of a thing that goes stale without anyone
noticing. These tests hold the three ways it can go wrong: by offering a flag
or an example that does not work, by drawing wider than it should, and by
losing the mark that makes it this tool's screen rather than any tool's.
