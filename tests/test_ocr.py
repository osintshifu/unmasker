"""Reading the page back, and comparing it with what the file says.

This was deferred for most of the project's life: it needs an OCR engine and a
renderer, two heavy external binaries, and that breaks *point it at a file, get
an answer*. The reason still holds, so it is off unless asked for. What changed
is that the rest of the tool now stands, which was the condition set for coming
back to it.

## Why it is worth the binaries

Every other detector here knows a trick. `covered_text` knows about filled
paths, `invisible_text` about render modes and opacity, `low_contrast_text`
about colour. Each was written after a producer was caught doing something
particular, and each would miss the next thing a producer invents.

This one knows nothing. It renders the page, reads the picture back, and asks
whether the words in the file are on it. A redaction technique nobody here has
thought of still fails that question.

## Why it can never be `DIRECT`

OCR is wrong constantly, and its being wrong looks exactly like concealment.
On `libreoffice-writer-properly-redacted.pdf` tesseract reads `Name:` as `TT`
and `Address:` as `ee`, because a black bar abutting a label defeats its
segmentation - three words that are plainly on the page, reported missing.

Which is why the threshold below exists, and why it is three. Measured across
the specimens: the control's longest run of consecutive unread words is **2**,
and every file that hides something has a run of **5 or more**. A single
missing word is an OCR failure far more often than it is a concealment; five in
a row is something covering them.
