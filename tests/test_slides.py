"""Presentations, in both families.

A deck hides two things no other container has.

A **slide marked hidden** is skipped when the deck is shown and travels with
the file exactly as it was authored. A **speaker note** was never on the screen
at all - which is why people write candid things in them, and why the candid
thing goes out with the file.

Both are the statement this tool makes everywhere: in the file, not on the
thing anybody looked at.

## Why this arrived last

`unmasker` refused decks outright for most of its life, and said so rather than
half-reading them. Reading a deck as a text document would have reported a
hidden slide and a speaker note as visible prose and then called the file
clean - the same defect the spreadsheet reader was written to remove.

The reader waited on a producer rather than on the parsing: `CONTRIBUTING.md`
is explicit that a detector proved only against a hand-built fixture proves
nothing about a real deck.
