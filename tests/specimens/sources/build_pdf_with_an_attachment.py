"""Build the PDF-carries-an-attachment specimen.

A PDF can hold whole other files. They are not on any page, no viewer shows
them without being asked, and printing the document does not print them - the
attachment travels with the file and appears nowhere in it.

The visible page here is a decision notice that says the tender was settled on
its merits and names no figure. The file carries a text note giving the reserve
price and saying one bidder knew it in advance.

Measured on the file this script writes:

    pages                  1
    visible text           a notice naming no number
    /Names/EmbeddedFiles   1 entry, `panel-note.txt`

Everything is invented: no such tender, no such panel, no such bidder.

## Why it is built this way

`pdfattach` is poppler's, and poppler is already what this corpus uses when a
measurement has to come from something other than the code under test. The
attachment is therefore written the way a real tool writes one, into
`/Names/EmbeddedFiles`, rather than assembled here from the specification -
which is the mistake this kind of reader is built on.

## The control

`libreoffice-writer-metadata-leak.pdf` is the same producer with no attachment
at all, and the detector has to stay silent on it. It is an existing specimen,
so none is added here.

Usage:

    python3 tests/specimens/sources/build_pdf_with_an_attachment.py tests/specimens/pdf
