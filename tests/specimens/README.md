# Specimens

Specimens live here and **are committed**, unlike the sibling project's corpus.
They are the test suite: a detector written against a hand-built fixture proves
nothing about a document a real producer wrote.

Each specimen records, in a sibling `.md` file, which tool produced it and how,
what a human sees when it is opened, and what is actually in the file
underneath.

Only synthetic or clearly licensed material. Nothing from a real case. Every
particular in these documents is invented; the e-mail domain is `example.org`,
which RFC 2606 reserves for the purpose.

| [`docx/libreoffice-writer-embedded-sheet.docx`](docx/libreoffice-writer-embedded-sheet.md) | LibreOffice 24.2 Writer | a summary with a small table pictured in it | the whole workbook behind the picture, as `word/embeddings/oleObject1.xlsx` |

| [`doc/libreoffice-writer-word97.doc`](doc/libreoffice-writer-word97.md) | LibreOffice 24.2 Writer, exported to Word 97 | an award notice naming nobody | two names, a title marked *do not circulate* and a company, in the compound file's property streams |
| [`doc/libreoffice-writer-word97-stories.doc`](doc/libreoffice-writer-word97-stories.md) | LibreOffice 24.2 Writer, exported to Word 97 | an award notice with a table, a header and a footnote | 237 of its 504 characters outside the main story — a comment, a header marked *internal circulation only*, a text box — and a hyperlink whose URL is on no page |
| [`docx/libreoffice-writer-hidden-run.docx`](docx/libreoffice-writer-hidden-run.md) | LibreOffice 24.2 Writer | two lines, one with a gap in it | a run carrying `w:vanish`, which Word does not draw |
| [`odt/libreoffice-writer-hidden-run.odt`](odt/libreoffice-writer-hidden-run.md) | LibreOffice 24.2 Writer | the same two lines | the same sentence, hidden by a *style* rather than by the run — the one difference between the containers |
| [`doc/libreoffice-writer-word97-marks.doc`](doc/libreoffice-writer-word97-marks.md) | LibreOffice 24.2 Writer, exported to Word 97 | three short paragraphs | a tracked deletion with its author and date, and a run carrying Word's hidden attribute, both in the piece table beside the printed text |
| [`xls/libreoffice-calc-excel97.xls`](xls/libreoffice-calc-excel97.md) | LibreOffice 24.2 Calc, exported to Excel 97 | a two-column sheet of scores | nothing this tool reads — it is here to hold still the claim that a workbook's text *was not read* |

Every specimen that hides text *on the page* is also found by `--ocr`, which
renders the page and reads the picture back and knows none of the mechanisms —
and every control stays silent under both. Two independent methods agreeing on
fourteen files is the strongest thing this directory has to say, and neither
could arrange it for the other.

The first two are failed redactions. The next two must not be reported, and for
different reasons: one was redacted correctly, the other has nothing to search.
The partial-bars file holds the detector honest about *how much* a bar covers.
The hidden-in-plain-sight file has nothing drawn over anything — everything it
hides, it hides by colour or by position — so every bar detector must stay
silent on it. The first DOCX is the tier-2 specimen, and every tier-2
detector fires on it exactly once. The second hides nothing by drawing or by
character: its deletions are text the application has agreed not to display.
The metadata pair is one source document in two containers, because the two
carry different amounts of the same metadata and a tool tried on one of them
would have a partial idea of what metadata is. The spreadsheet pair is the same
argument about hiding: OOXML writes it as an attribute on the thing hidden, ODF
puts a whole sheet's visibility behind a named style, and a reader that got
either wrong would disagree with the other. The .ods of that pair is also the
file that caught the worst bug this project has had - `unmasker` read its
hidden row, hidden column and hidden sheet as ordinary visible prose and then
reported the workbook clean.

## Rebuilding them

`sources/` holds the builders. They need `soffice`, `google-chrome`, `gs`,
`pdftotext` and `exiftool` on `PATH`, and they write each file through those
tools rather than emitting its bytes directly — which is the point. Where a
measurement is needed, it comes from poppler rather than from this project's
own code, for the same reason. See each specimen's `.md` for the exact
command.

The committed PDFs are the artefacts under test. Rebuilding produces a file that
differs in its `/CreationDate` and in font subset naming, so a rebuild is not
byte-identical and is not expected to be. Rebuild to add a specimen or to check
a builder still runs, not as part of the test suite.

## What is still missing

Named here so their absence is not mistaken for coverage:

- **A bar covering a glyph vertically** rather than horizontally — a rule drawn
  along a line clips its descenders, which is the same fraction arrived at a
  different way. `coverage-edge.pdf` closed the horizontal case and records
  where the threshold is; the threshold is on area and does not care which way
  the overlap runs, but no file demonstrates that.
- **Text outside the MediaBox.** LibreOffice refuses to emit it, so the
  off-page case is represented only by a CropBox smaller than the MediaBox.
  Another producer is needed for the other half.
- **A tiling pattern behind text.** `text-on-an-image.pdf` covers the picture
  case; a pattern fill is the other way a background becomes unreadable.
- **An XMP packet written in attribute form**, which is how Adobe writes them.
  Handled, and only a synthetic test exercises it: exiftool writes element form
  and offers no way to ask for the other.
- **A true PDF shading.** Both LibreOffice and Chrome flatten a gradient before
  it reaches the file — LibreOffice into dozens of solid strips, Chrome into a
  single fill — so no producer here emits `sh` at all.
- **XMP in a DOCX or a TIFF.** JPEG is covered by
  `exiftool-xmp-history.jpg`; those two containers carry packets as well and
  no file here holds one.
- **An angle other than 0 or 90 degrees**, and text rotated by a page's
  `/Rotate` entry rather than by the content stream. The grouping is general -
  it projects onto the text direction - but only the right angle is exercised
  by a producer.
- **Producers not on this machine.** Acrobat and Word draw their own way, and
  LibreOffice and Chrome already disagree with each other.
- **A signed PDF**, and with it the whole question of signature coverage. A
  signature's `/ByteRange` names the bytes it covers, and a file longer than
  that range has been appended to since it was signed - which is a strong,
  entirely deterministic finding and the natural companion to
  `earlier-revision`. Nothing here can sign one: `pdfsig` only verifies, pypdf
  does not sign, and LibreOffice needs an NSS certificate database that this
  machine has no `certutil` to build. The detector is **not written**, because
  a detector whose only fixture was assembled from the specification is the
  mistake this file exists to prevent.
- **A document set in a font that postdates it.** A typeface has a first
  release, so a file dating itself before one it uses is saying two things that
  cannot both be true - the reasoning `SecurityRonin/font-provenance` collects
  the evidence for. It is deliberately **not implemented**: the anchors that
  matter are Calibri, Aptos and DengXian, none of which is installed on this
  machine, so the only anchor testable here would be one nobody backdates a
  document with. A table of dates that fires on real documents while every
  tested case is irrelevant is the HEIC failure again, with the added risk of
  being confidently wrong rather than merely silent. It needs the fonts, or it
  needs a cited source per anchor, and until then the absence is the honest
  state.
- **Reading inside an OpenDocument embedded object.** The OOXML half works:
  `libreoffice-writer-embedded-sheet.docx` carries a workbook as one archive
  member, and the hidden sheet in it is found. `Object 1/` is a *directory* of
  members rather than a file, so there is nothing to hand a reader. Reassembling
  one into a package would mean this repository writing the document it then
  reads, which is the thing the corpus exists to stop, so the ODT specimen is
  reported as carrying an object and not descended into.
- **An annotation carrying an appearance stream.** Comments now have a
  specimen, but `/AP` is where a bar drawn as an annotation would live, and no
  producer here writes one — LibreOffice draws its shapes into the content
  stream, and a `/Square` written by hand renders in nothing without an `/AP`,
  which is precisely why the appearance stream is the part that matters. The
  tool notes such an annotation rather than passing over it.
- **A redaction that clips the second half of a line**, which is the hard
  case: evidence identical to `libreoffice-calc-clipped-overflow.pdf` and the
  opposite meaning. No producer here writes one, and the tool reports it
  exactly as it reports that file — which is correct, and is why the finding
  is weakened rather than filtered.
- **A clip that is not a rectangle**, and text clipped by a form XObject's
  `/BBox` rather than by a `W n` path.
- **A raster page with an invisible OCR text layer underneath**, which is a
  failed redaction that `flattened-to-image.pdf` does not represent.
- **A sheet marked `veryHidden`**, which the spreadsheet's own interface offers
  no way to undo. LibreOffice cannot set it in either format, so the reader
  handles it and only a synthetic test exercises it.
- **An `autoFilter` element**, which records what a filter was set to.
  LibreOffice's ODS writes none, and its .xlsx export drops the filter/hidden
  distinction altogether.
- **A 1904-epoch workbook**, a built-in `numFmtId` used without its format
  code, a time of day, and a conditional or coloured number format. Excel
  writes the first two routinely; LibreOffice defines every format explicitly
  and exports `date1904="false"`, so all four are covered only synthetically.
- **A tracked deletion that kept its cells.** Both formats allow the removed
  content to be stored with the deletion; neither producer here writes any, so
  a deletion always quotes nothing and the other path is untested.
- **A tracked insertion**, and a formatting-only revision (`rfmt`), which is
  the spreadsheet's `w:rPrChange`.
- **Excel and Word themselves.** Neither is on this machine, so every OOXML
  file here was written by LibreOffice.
- **Excel's BIFF records and PowerPoint's record stream.** Word's piece table
  is read since 0.3.0; these two are each a separate problem of their own size
  and neither is solved. The report says a workbook's text *was not read*
  rather than that it has none, and no metadata value in one is called
  undisclosed, because nothing compared it against a page. `xls/` holds a
  workbook so that claim cannot quietly be loosened once the format beside it
  became readable.
- **Word's character formatting other than the hidden attribute**, and the
  objects a .doc carries in its `ObjectPool` storage. The report names the
  storage rather than opening it.
- **White text on a white background**, in any word processor. It is the same
  trick as a hidden run and it is not read, because unlike `w:vanish` it is
  not a property that means *do not draw*: it means *draw in this colour*, and
  whether that hides anything depends on the paragraph, table-cell, section
  and page backgrounds behind it. `low-contrast-text` answers the question for
  a PDF by measuring what was actually painted. Guessing it from a colour
  attribute alone would report white-on-white and miss white-on-pale-grey, and
  would fire on a coloured banner where the background is the one thing the
  reader can see.
- **A comment's date in a .doc.** The 30-byte `ATRD` LibreOffice writes has an
  owner index and initials and no date at all, so there is nothing on this
  machine to test a reader of the longer form against.
- **PowerPoint itself**, and a presentation comment (`ppt/comments/`), which
  LibreOffice does not write. Decks were the one gap here that no amount of
  code could close - nothing on this machine could write one until
  `libreoffice-impress` was installed.
- **A slide with `show="1"`**, which PowerPoint writes and LibreOffice omits,
  and **a deck whose slide parts are numbered out of order**. Both are held by
  synthetic tests, because the specimen cannot tell the two implementations
  apart — and mutation testing is what said so.
- **Word's own OOXML.** Word is not on this machine, so every DOCX here was
  written by LibreOffice. It emits valid revision markup, but two producers
  never agree about everything — the PDF specimens proved that twice.
- **`w:moveFrom` / `w:moveTo` from a real producer.** LibreOffice does not emit
  move tracking; the reader handles it and only a synthetic test exercises it.
- **Nothing, on this front.** Every detector now fires on a committed file that
  a producer wrote, and `test_every_detector_now_has_a_specimen` holds that
  position. It was the gap that mattered most: a detector covered only by
  hand-built pages is exactly the shape of the bug that started this project.
