"""The compound file: a filesystem inside a file.

`.doc`, `.xls` and `.ppt` are not zips and not XML. Each is a FAT filesystem in
one file - sectors, an allocation table, a directory tree - with a second,
smaller filesystem nested inside it for streams below 4096 bytes. Nothing in
the standard library reads one, and one runtime dependency is not going to
become two.

Every number asserted here was read out of the specimen before the reader
existed. That order matters more than usual for a binary format: the
specification permits a great deal that no producer writes, and the one thing
it does not warn about is that in a real Word file **every stream worth having
is under the 4096-byte cutoff**, so a reader that leaves the mini stream for
later reads nothing at all.
