"""OpenDocument: the format `unmasker` used to refuse outright.

Until this existed the tool answered an .odt with "it looks like an
OpenDocument file, which unmasker does not read yet", which is a large refusal:
ODF is LibreOffice's native format and the one a great deal of European
government and legal work is written in.

The care this format needs, and OOXML does not, is that **the two things which
must not be read as body text live inside the body**. `<text:tracked-changes>`
sits at the top of `office:text` and holds every deleted passage;
`<office:annotation>` sits inline in its paragraph and holds a comment.
Extracting the body naively reports both as ordinary visible prose - exactly
backwards, since a reader of the page sees neither.
