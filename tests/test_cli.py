"""The command line, the exit codes and the report.

Three rules from `CONTRIBUTING.md` are load-bearing here and each has a test:

- **Nothing is truncated.** A value too long for the line wraps; it never ends
  in an ellipsis. A reader who has to fetch the value another way did not need
  to read the report.
- **"Nothing found" has two meanings**, and the report must not let them blur.
- **Every command the tool prints must run in the shell that printed it.**
  A screen that names a command the reader cannot run is disproved by the
  first thing they try.

The exit code is the CI gate. There is deliberately no
`--strict`: the default non-zero exit when findings exist *is* the gate, and a
second channel of meaning before the classes of finding are known is easy to add
later and hard to remove.
