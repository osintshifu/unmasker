"""The preview that still shows what was cropped out.

A photograph carries a small copy of itself in its EXIF, for a camera's screen
and a file browser's grid. **Cropping the photograph does not regenerate it.**
Cut a face, a name or a plate out of a picture and the preview in the file
still shows the frame you cut it out of.

Not a reading of the specification: ImageMagick carries the old thumbnail
through a crop **unasked**, which is how the specimen is built. A person
opening the file cannot see the cropped strip; every EXIF reader can.

## Why the shape and not the pixels

Comparing the preview to the picture properly means decoding two JPEGs, which
means a second runtime dependency, which `CONTRIBUTING.md` says has to be
argued for in writing. It does not have to be: a JPEG states its own dimensions
in a marker, and so does the thumbnail, because the thumbnail is a JPEG too.
**A preview a different shape from its picture was not made from it** - and
that is bytes, not pixels.

So the default finding is `circumstantial` and reads the headers. `--ocr`,
which already exists and already costs two binaries, does the rest: read the
preview back and report what is legible in it and absent from the picture.
