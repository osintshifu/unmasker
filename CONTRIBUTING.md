# Contributing

Thank you for looking. This project has a small number of rules, and they are
worth reading before writing code: a change that breaks one of them will be
asked to change back.

## Setting up

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"
.venv/bin/pytest
.venv/bin/ruff check .
```

Python 3.10 or later. One runtime dependency, `pypdf`.

## The one thing this tool must never do

**State something the evidence does not support.** No "this document was
manipulated". Show what a human sees, show what a machine reads, name the gap,
and stop.

A reader who disagrees with a finding must be able to see why. A tool that
concludes for its reader is a tool whose conclusion has to be trusted blindly,
and nobody should trust this one blindly.

Everything below follows from that.

## A new detector needs a specimen a real producer wrote

This is the rule that matters most, and it is not negotiable.

A fixture built from a specification proves that your reader agrees with your
reading of the spec. It does not prove it agrees with LibreOffice. A reader
built that way can decode nothing at all on every real file and still hold a
fully green test suite, because no real encoder writes files the way the
standard reads.

So:

1. Write a **builder** in `tests/specimens/sources/` that drives a real
   producer — `soffice`, `google-chrome`, `gs`, `tesseract`, `exiftool` — to
   write the file.
2. Commit the produced file. The specimens **are** the test suite here, which
   is why they are in git rather than gitignored.
3. Write a `.md` beside it recording what produced it, what a human sees, what
   is actually in the file, and **what it does not carry**.

Everything in a specimen must be invented. No real documents, no real people;
the e-mail domain is `example.org`, which RFC 2606 reserves for the purpose.

If the producer does something the specification does not describe — and it
will — that is the most valuable thing in your pull request. Write it down.

## Watch the test fail first

Write the test, run it, read the failure, *then* implement. A test written
afterwards passes against broken code.

Check the failure is the one you expected. An `ImportError` is not evidence
that your test works.

## Break your own rule and see whether the suite notices

Before opening a pull request, take each claim your docstrings make, break it
in the source, and run the suite. Anything that stays green is a claim nothing
is holding. If you find one, the fix is a test, and that test is the
interesting part of the change.

## Report a line, never a show-operation

If you are touching the PDF detectors: producers disagree wildly about how much
text one drawing operation carries. Chrome writes one glyph per `Tj`; tesseract
writes one operation per word. Group by **line on the page**, using
`detectors._lines`, or a single hidden line becomes eighty-seven findings.

`test_no_detector_reports_per_show_operation` asks the question directly.

## Do not rank findings against each other

A page can have a bar over its text *and* invisible characters *and* stale
metadata. Those are three findings, not one winner. Ranking them means the
stronger claim deletes the more valuable one: a geotagged photograph that had
also been downloaded would report its source URL and no GPS at all.

Nothing here sorts by strength, and `Finding` carries no score.

## "Nothing found" has two meanings

It can mean *searched, and it is not there*. It can mean *there was nothing to
search*. A reader who confuses those has drawn a conclusion the tool never
supported.

Carry the difference in the data rather than reconstructing it later — a PDF
with no content stream to parse is not a PDF with nothing hidden, and the
report has to be able to say which it met.

## The name of a field is evidence

`LibreOffice/24.2.7.2$Linux_X86_64` contains a dotted quad. Pattern-matching
alone reports an IP address — but the field is called `Producer`, so it is a
version. Every metadata field's meaning is decided by its name **and its
container**: a PDF's `/Creator` is an application, an OOXML `dc:creator` is a
person.

Context you already have beats a cleverer pattern.

## Colour and words

**Colour encodes how the tool knows, never how bad the finding is.** Three
classes — `direct`, `circumstantial`, `self-reported` — and nothing else in
the output may use colour.

Prefer a word a reader can argue with over a number that implies a precision
you do not have. `55` reads as a probability; it never was one.

## Modes are commands, not flags

If an option ignores most of the other options and is mutually exclusive with
its neighbours, it is a subcommand. `--json` changes the shape of the output,
not what the tool did, which is what keeps it a flag.

## Output

- **Nothing is truncated.** A value too long for the line wraps. An ellipsis
  sends the reader to fetch the value another way.
- **Nothing draws past the width it declared.**
- **Size a column per section, not once per screen.** One global width makes a
  layout look *almost* aligned, which reads worse than not aligning it.
- A description that restates its flag teaches the reader to skip
  descriptions, and once they skip one they skip the rest.
- Every command the tool prints must run in the shell that printed it. A screen
  disproved by the first thing a reader tries loses credibility for everything
  else on it.

## Commits

Prose, and no trailers. Say what changed and **why** — the why is the part
that cannot be recovered from the diff. If a change corrects an earlier
assumption, say what the assumption was.

Stage deliberately. Name the paths, or check `git status` first; `git add -A`
is how a build artefact reaches a public repository.

## What a good pull request looks like

- a specimen a producer wrote, with its `.md`
- a test you watched fail
- the producer fact you measured, written down where the next person will hit it
- the gap your change does *not* close, named rather than left implied

## Reporting a bug

The most useful report is a file. If it is not one you can share — and in this
line of work it usually is not — a builder that produces something with the
same shape is just as good, and better for everyone.

If a finding is wrong, say what the tool printed and what the document actually
shows. A false positive is a bug of the same size as a miss here: a report a
reader learns to scroll past has stopped working.

## Security

See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md). In short: this tool parses hostile files by
design, so a crash or a hang on a malformed document is a bug worth reporting
privately first.
