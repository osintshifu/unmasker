---

unmasker finds content that survives inside a document but is hidden, covered,
deleted, filtered, cropped or otherwise absent from what a person normally
sees.

A black rectangle drawn over text is not a redaction. The page may look clean
while the original text remains in the file and is still readable by a parser.
unmasker reports that mismatch and stops there - evidence, not a verdict.

```bash
unmasker tests/specimens/pdf/libreoffice-writer-black-bars.pdf
```

Every finding says what a human sees, what a machine reads, where the mismatch
is and how the tool knows.

That file is a specimen committed to this repository, as is every other
example on this page. Clone it and the commands run.

## Installation

```bash
pipx install unmasker
```

Or:

```bash
uv tool install unmasker
```

Python 3.10 or later. The default install has one runtime dependency: `pypdf`.
unmasker runs locally, makes no network requests and never modifies the file it
is given. Two optional flags call other programs — `--ocr` needs ghostscript and
tesseract, `--render` needs LibreOffice — and both are off unless asked for.

From a checkout:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/osint-shifu/unmasker
cd unmasker
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e .
.venv/bin/unmasker document.pdf
```

## Usage

```text
unmasker <file>   [options]
unmasker <folder> [options]
```

Scan one file:

```bash
unmasker document.pdf
```

Survey a folder:

```bash
unmasker ~/cases/kowalski
```

Produce machine-readable or shareable output:

```bash
unmasker document.pdf --json
unmasker document.pdf --md > report.md
unmasker ~/cases/kowalski --html > report.html
```

| Option | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `--json` | one JSON object, for a script to sort or filter |
| `--html` | one self-contained HTML report, ready to send to someone |
| `--md` | Markdown for a wiki, a ticket or a pull request |
| `--ocr` | render a page and read it back to catch mismatches without knowing the hiding technique |
| `--render` | lay a word-processor document out with LibreOffice and look at what it paints |
| `--width N` | wrap terminal output at N columns |
| `--version` | print the version and exit |
| `-h`, `--help` | show the full option list |

Exit status is part of the interface:

| Code | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| `0` | read, searched, nothing found |
| `1` | read, searched, findings exist |
| `2` | could not be read |

> **A file that could not be read is not a file that came back clean.**
> unmasker keeps those states separate so a pipeline cannot silently treat
> failure as a clean result.

## What it finds

| Area | Examples |
| :--- | :--- |
| PDF pages | covered text, text under images, invisible text, low contrast, off-page content |
| PDF revisions | pages and text left in the file by an incremental update, which the current document no longer points at |
| Unicode | zero-width characters, bidi controls, tag characters, mixed scripts |
| Word / ODT | tracked deletions, comments, revision history, metadata leaks |
| Excel / Calc | hidden sheets, rows and columns, filtered rows, tracked cell changes |
| PowerPoint / Impress | hidden slides, speaker notes, and a shape drawn over text on a slide |
| JPEG | stale EXIF thumbnails that can preserve content removed by cropping, and the XMP edit history an editor left behind |
| Metadata | undisclosed values, local filesystem paths and conflicting metadata copies |
| Legacy Word | a `.doc`'s text, story by story — body, footnotes, headers, footers, text boxes — with its comments, tracked changes and hidden runs |
| Legacy Office | what a `.xls` or `.ppt` says about itself, out of its compound-file property streams |
| Attachments | whole files carried inside a document, which no page mentions — and what a carried workbook hides in turn |
| OCR comparison | text present in the file but absent from the rendered page, and the reverse |

Supported inputs are PDF, DOCX, ODT, XLSX, ODS, PPTX, ODP, JPEG, UTF-8 text and legacy `.doc`, plus `.xls` and `.ppt` for their metadata.
Content is identified from the file itself rather than trusted solely from the
extension.

### What runs on what

Not every check runs on every format, and a check that did not run cannot
report anything. **If a format is missing from a row, that question was never
asked about your file** — which is not the same answer as asking it and
finding nothing.

| What is checked | Runs on |
| :--- | :--- |
| a filled shape or an image drawn over text | PDF, PPTX, ODP |
| the rest of what the page paints: faint text, text the page does not paint, text off the page | PDF |
| characters in the text: zero-width, direction controls, tag characters, mixed scripts | PDF, DOCX, ODT, XLSX, ODS, PPTX, ODP, DOC, text |
| text the file marks as not to be drawn | DOCX, ODT, DOC |
| hidden sheets, rows and columns, and filtered rows | XLSX, ODS |
| hidden slides and speaker notes | PPTX, ODP |
| the embedded thumbnail against the image it sits in | JPEG |
| tracked changes and comments | DOCX, ODT, DOC, XLSX, ODS |
| whole files carried inside the document | PDF, DOCX, ODT, XLSX, ODS, PPTX, ODP |
| earlier revisions the file still holds | PDF |
| metadata against the document's own text | PDF, DOCX, ODT, XLSX, ODS, PPTX, ODP, DOC, XLS, PPT, JPEG |

`--render` adds DOCX and ODT to the first row, by laying the document out with
LibreOffice and looking at what it paints. It answers about that rendering
rather than about the file, so what it finds is circumstantial and says so.

This table is checked against the readers, so it cannot drift away from what
the code can actually see.

## Practical examples

### Text under an image

```bash
unmasker tests/specimens/pdf/libreoffice-writer-image-over-text.pdf
```

```text
  unmasker                                                       1 finding

  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  ● 22 characters under an image at x 123.3-245.9, y 702.8-720.0;   page 1
    an image over a text layer is also what a scan of a printed
    page looks like, and there the two normally agree; the rest of
    the line still reads "Subject:"
  │ human sees     ▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒
  │ machine reads  Ludmila Wieczorek-Test

  notes                                                             1 note

```

An image over text is also what a scan of a printed page looks like.
unmasker says so in the finding rather than calling it a redaction.

  searched 12 files. unmasker <file> for the detail, --json for all of it.
```

A directory scan reports what was read, what could not be read, which detector
kinds appeared and which files contain findings. It does not rank files by
"severity". Use the detailed file report or `--json` for every finding.

### Read the rendered page back

```bash
unmasker scan.pdf --ocr
```

`--ocr` asks a different question: does the text stored in the document agree
with the page after it is rendered? This can expose a hiding technique for
which there is no dedicated detector yet.

For PDF page comparison it requires `ghostscript` and `tesseract` on `PATH` and
costs seconds per page, so it is intentionally opt-in and refused for directory
surveys.

## Detector reference

The detector slug is stable output intended for reports and automation.

### Page and rendering

| Detector | What it reports |
| :--- | :--- |
| `covered-text` | text underneath a filled shape — per character in a PDF, per text box on a slide |
| `text-under-image` | text underneath an image, kept distinct from a filled-shape redaction |
| `invisible-text` | text the file tells the application not to draw — a PDF render mode that paints nothing, or a Word run marked hidden |
| `low-contrast-text` | text too close in colour to the background behind it |
| `off-page-text` | text outside the visible page or crop box |
| `unrendered-text` | words stored in the file that OCR cannot find on the rendered page |
| `unextractable-text` | words visible to OCR on the rendered page but absent from the extracted text |

### Characters

| Detector | What it reports |
| :--- | :--- |
| `zero-width` | zero-width spaces, joiners, soft hyphens and word joiners |
| `bidi-control` | Unicode direction controls that can change how a string appears on screen |
| `tag-characters` | plane-14 Unicode tag characters, decoded when possible |
| `mixed-script` | a single word containing characters from multiple scripts |

### Spreadsheets

| Detector | What it reports |
| :--- | :--- |
| `hidden-sheet` | a hidden or very-hidden sheet that still carries values |
| `hidden-rows` | hidden rows that still carry values, collapsed into blocks |
| `hidden-columns` | hidden columns that still carry values |
| `filtered-rows` | rows currently excluded by a worksheet filter |
| `changed-cell` | a tracked cell change, including the replaced value when available |

### Presentations

| Detector | What it reports |
| :--- | :--- |
| `hidden-slide` | a slide stored in the deck but skipped when the presentation is shown |
| `speaker-notes` | speaker-note text that never appears on the projected slide |

### Images

| Detector | What it reports |
| :--- | :--- |
| `stale-thumbnail` | an embedded EXIF preview whose dimensions show it was not regenerated from the current image |

### Container, revisions and metadata

| Detector | What it reports |
| :--- | :--- |
| `deleted-text` | text preserved inside a tracked deletion |
| `comment` | comments and annotations stored with the document |
| `revision-history` | document revision authorship and edit history |
| `undisclosed-metadata` | metadata values that do not appear in the document's visible text |
| `metadata-path` | filesystem paths exposed by document metadata |
| `metadata-conflict` | contradictory copies of metadata stored inside the same file |
| `attached-file` | a whole file carried inside the document, on no page and not printed with it |
| `earlier-revision` | text an earlier revision of the file still holds, which no page shows now |

## Evidence model

unmasker reports observable mismatches. It does not decide whether a document
is malicious, manipulated or safe.

Each finding carries one of three evidence bases:

- **direct** - the relevant bytes are in the file and were read out directly
- **circumstantial** - the observation is consistent with hiding, but an innocent explanation can also fit
- **self-reported** - the document or application reports the fact about itself

There are no severity scores or synthetic confidence percentages. Different
questions are not ranked against each other.

> **"Nothing found" and "nothing could be searched" are different results.**
> unmasker keeps them separate. JSON exposes this explicitly through the
> `searched` field.

Values are not shortened with ellipses. If evidence is long, the report wraps
it instead of silently dropping part of it.

## Reports

The terminal report is for triage. Three stdout formats are available when the
result needs to be stored, processed or sent to someone else:

- `--json` for automation
- `--html` for a self-contained human-readable report
- `--md` for Markdown-based systems

unmasker treats report content as untrusted because every quoted value came
from a file being investigated. HTML values are escaped, Markdown evidence is
fenced or escaped, and generated HTML contains no JavaScript or external
resources.

The tool has no `--out` option. Redirection keeps the core rule simple:
unmasker itself never writes to the input or to the case directory.

## JSON and automation

`--json` writes one object on stdout while the exit status remains usable as a
pipeline gate:

```bash
unmasker document.pdf --json > findings.json || echo "findings exist"
```

The JSON shape is versioned separately from the package version:

| Field | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| `schema` | `unmasker.scan/1` for one file or `unmasker.survey/1` for a folder |
| `version` | the unmasker build that produced the report |
| `searched` | `false` means there was nothing to search, not that a search came back empty |
| `sha256` | the digest of the bytes that were read, so a finding can be checked against the file rather than the path |
| `location.inside` | present when a finding came out of a file the document carries, naming it |

```bash
unmasker tests/specimens/pdf/libreoffice-writer-image-over-text.pdf --json
```

```json

        "U+0073",
        "U+0074"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The `/1` changes only when the JSON shape changes incompatibly. A normal
package release does not force downstream consumers to guess whether their
parser still works.

## Design principles

- **Evidence, not verdicts.** Report what can be shown and leave interpretation to the analyst.
- **Absence is explicit.** Unreadable, unsearched and searched-with-no-findings are different states.
- **Read-only.** Input files are never modified.
- **Local.** No uploads and no network requests.
- **Real specimens.** Detectors are tested against files produced by real applications, not only hand-built fixtures.
- **No hidden ranking.** Findings are grouped by what was observed, not by an invented severity score.

### What unmasker is not

unmasker is not a malware scanner, DLP system, authenticity classifier or
forensic verdict engine. It exposes discrepancies and residual content so a
human or a downstream system can decide what they mean.

## How it is tested

Every detector fires on a committed specimen written by a real producer,
including LibreOffice, headless Chrome, Ghostscript, Tesseract, exiftool,
ImageMagick, poppler and pypdf. There are 48 of them and each has a provenance note describing how
it was produced, what a person sees and what is actually stored inside.

This matters because real producers routinely disagree with assumptions made
from a file-format specification. The first PDF specimen, for example, showed
that LibreOffice represented a redaction bar differently from the shape the
initial detector design expected.

Independent tooling such as Poppler is used where specimens need measurements,
and detector behavior is mutation-tested so a broken rule has to break a test.
The README is checked against the repository so the front page cannot silently
drift away from the code: the detector list, the detector badge, the specimen
count, and every example on this page - each command is run
and its output compared to the block printed beneath it.

## Limits

- No verdicts about whether a document was manipulated or malicious.
- No writing to the input file and no network access.
- What a page paints is read straight from the file for PDF, and computed from the file for `.pptx` and `.odp`, where every shape carries absolute coordinates against a known slide size.
- A word processor states neither. Its text flows, so a `.docx` or `.odt` says there is a filled shape and says there is text and never says one is over the other. `--render` answers it by laying the document out with LibreOffice and looking at what got painted — which means handing the file to another program, and answering about that rendering rather than about the file. Word lays a page out differently, so a bar that covers a name there may miss it here. Every finding from it is circumstantial and names the rendering it came from.
- A `.doc` is read for its text as well as its metadata: the piece table, every story, and the property tables that say which characters are deleted or hidden. Its embedded objects are not opened, and character formatting other than the hidden attribute is not read.
- `.xls` and `.ppt` are read for what they say about themselves, not for their text. The compound-file container and both property streams are read; the BIFF and PowerPoint record streams inside them are not.
- Signature coverage is not checked. A signed PDF's `/ByteRange` says which bytes it covers, and no signed specimen could be produced to test a detector against.
- XMP is read in PDF and JPEG. DOCX and TIFF carry packets too and are not read yet.
- Producer coverage is not universal. Microsoft Word and Adobe Acrobat are not part of the current specimen corpus, and different producers can encode the same feature differently.
- OCR is optional, slower than structural detection and depends on external tools.

See [`tests/specimens/README.md`](tests/specimens/README.md) for the current
producer coverage and explicitly documented gaps.
